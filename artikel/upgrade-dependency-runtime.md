# Upgrade Dependency dan Runtime dengan Risiko Terkendali

## Assignment lock

- **Writer task:** Expand this file into one complete article answering: “Upgrade Dependency dan Runtime dengan Risiko Terkendali”
- **Reader and situation:** Team facing stale packages, runtime end-of-life, or vulnerabilities
- **Reader outcome:** Inventory support status, dependency graph, changes, test coverage, security urgency, compatibility, rollout, rollback, and evidence
- **Primary intent:** Plan routine and major technology upgrades
- **Reader community:** `Codev.id`
- **Primary friendly address:** `Teman Codev.id`
- **Natural variants:** `Sobat Codev.id` and `Kawan Codev.id`
- **Address cadence:** use a friendly project-community address three to five times in a typical long article, only at natural conversational pivots.
- **Scope boundary:** Does not recommend blind bulk updates or postpone critical fixes; CDV-09-A04 owns supply-chain controls
- **Final public route:** `/artikel/upgrade-dependency-runtime.html`
- **Appointed CMS date:** `2026-03-06` (`editorial_backfill`; preserve exactly)
- **Target length:** normally 1,400–2,200 useful words; stop earlier if the answer is complete.
- **Do not drift:** do not turn this page into a broad category page, sales landing page, or substitute for professional/project approval.

## Opening instructions

- Open with the exact short salutation: **“Halo, Teman Codev.id!”**
- Start with the concrete decision, confusion, risk, or costly shortcut behind **Upgrade Dependency dan Runtime dengan Risiko Terkendali**.
- Give the short answer within the first two or three paragraphs.
- State what evidence or condition can change that answer.
- Later, sprinkle `Teman Codev.id`, `Sobat Codev.id`, or `Kawan Codev.id` at useful warnings, decisions, examples, or the conclusion; do not force them into every section.
- Do not use a generic industry-history or “Di era digital” introduction.


<!-- BEGIN MANAGED IMAGE PLAN -->
## Image plan

- **Image ID:** `LOCAL-001`
- **Source type:** `local`
- **Placement:** after the opening has answered the main question, before the first detailed H2
- **Exact Markdown to insert:** `![Ilustrasi CODEV](/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CODEV.png)`
- **Caption/credit:** Aset lokal proyek; jangan klaim sebagai dokumentasi proyek tertentu.
- **Selection basis:** filename/source metadata identifies `CODEV` as relevant content media; no pixels were inspected.
- **Hard boundary:** do not infer or describe unseen visual details, project ownership, location, people, brands, condition, performance, or outcome.
- **Substitution rule:** do not replace this image. If unavailable or provenance is incomplete, insert `[NEEDS IMAGE REVIEW: LOCAL-001]` and continue drafting the prose.

## Evidence packet

Use the original source links below. Do not cite this outline or `GLOBAL_RESEARCH.md`.

### KR-07

- **Original sources:** [CISA SBOM resources](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom), [NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final), [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground dependency inventory, vendor evaluation, provenance, and integration failure planning.
- **Safe grounded facts:** An SBOM improves component transparency but does not establish safety. A repository score is a signal, not due diligence.
- **Limits:** Current vendor terms, APIs, quotas, subprocessors, and vulnerabilities require GATE-04 and GATE-09.

### KR-13

- **Original sources:** [NIST SSDF publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf/publications), [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), [Google Search site-move guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/site-move-with-url-changes).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground dependency/runtime maintenance, vulnerability prioritization, migration, recovery, and decommissioning.
- **Safe grounded facts:** Vulnerability severity is not the sole prioritization input; exposure, exploitation, business impact, fix safety, rollback, and ownership matter. URL/data migrations need inventories and reconciliation.
- **Limits:** Never prescribe replacement from age alone or delete history/data without GATE-02, GATE-05, and GATE-08.

## Evidence gates

- **TOPIC-GATE:** GATE-02, GATE-05, GATE-08

If a gate affects the article's main conclusion, keep a visible `[NEEDS ...]` marker for coordinator review. Do not guess.

## Internal-link plan

### Existing local routes

- `/` — use only if it helps the reader's next step; verify the anchor describes the destination.

### Planned sibling articles

These are future routes. Do not link them as live until their HTML exists.

## Draft completion checklist

- [ ] Opening answers the main question within two or three paragraphs.
- [ ] The article opens with `Halo, Teman Codev.id!` and uses friendly `Codev.id` community address naturally three to five times total.
- [ ] Every H2 above has been replaced with finished, non-repetitive prose.
- [ ] Facts, project facts, inferences, assumptions, and judgments are not blurred together.
- [ ] Every consequential claim has an original source or `[NEEDS ...]` marker.
- [ ] No exact standard clause, number, price, test result, capacity, warranty, or personal experience was invented.
- [ ] Internal links use exact listed routes and helpful natural anchors.
- [ ] Future sibling routes are not presented as live.
- [ ] The public prose does not mention prompts, outlines, SEO, AI, or evidence gates.
- [ ] Front matter is preserved; `status` changed from `outline` to `draft` only after completion.
- [ ] Conclusion gives a concrete next action and an honest limit.
