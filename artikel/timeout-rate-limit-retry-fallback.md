# Timeout, Rate Limit, Retry, dan Fallback Dependensi

## Assignment lock

- **Writer task:** Expand this file into one complete article answering: “Timeout, Rate Limit, Retry, dan Fallback Dependensi”
- **Reader and situation:** Engineer operating a third-party integration
- **Reader outcome:** Classify failures, set deadlines, retry/backoff, circuit/fallback behavior, queueing, user messaging, reconciliation, and alerts
- **Primary intent:** Keep a product safe when a dependency slows or fails
- **Reader community:** `Codev.id`
- **Primary friendly address:** `Teman Codev.id`
- **Natural variants:** `Sobat Codev.id` and `Kawan Codev.id`
- **Address cadence:** use a friendly project-community address three to five times in a typical long article, only at natural conversational pivots.
- **Scope boundary:** Does not claim a dependency can be made fully reliable; CDV-12-A05 owns incident response
- **Final public route:** `/artikel/timeout-rate-limit-retry-fallback.html`
- **Appointed CMS date:** `2025-09-30` (`editorial_backfill`; preserve exactly)
- **Target length:** normally 1,400–2,200 useful words; stop earlier if the answer is complete.
- **Do not drift:** do not turn this page into a broad category page, sales landing page, or substitute for professional/project approval.

## Opening instructions

- Open with the exact short salutation: **“Halo, Teman Codev.id!”**
- Start with the concrete decision, confusion, risk, or costly shortcut behind **Timeout, Rate Limit, Retry, dan Fallback Dependensi**.
- Give the short answer within the first two or three paragraphs.
- State what evidence or condition can change that answer.
- Later, sprinkle `Teman Codev.id`, `Sobat Codev.id`, or `Kawan Codev.id` at useful warnings, decisions, examples, or the conclusion; do not force them into every section.
- Do not use a generic industry-history or “Di era digital” introduction.

## Image plan

- **Image ID:** `LOCAL-001`
- **Source type:** `local`
- **Placement:** after the opening has answered the main question, before the first detailed H2
- **Exact Markdown to insert:** `![Ilustrasi CODEV](/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CODEV.png)`
- **Caption/credit:** Aset lokal proyek; jangan klaim sebagai dokumentasi proyek tertentu.
- **Selection basis:** filename/source metadata identifies `CODEV` as relevant content media; no pixels were inspected.
- **Hard boundary:** do not infer or describe unseen visual details, project ownership, location, people, brands, condition, performance, or outcome.
- **Substitution rule:** do not replace this image. If unavailable or provenance is incomplete, insert `[NEEDS IMAGE REVIEW: LOCAL-001]` and continue drafting the prose.

## Evidence packet

Use the original source links below. Do not cite this outline or `GLOBAL_RESEARCH.md`.

### KR-04

- **Original sources:** [OpenAPI Specification 3.1.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html), [OAuth 2.0 Security BCP—RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9700/), [WebAuthn Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/), [OWASP API Security Top 10 2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground contract-first APIs, authorization flows, passkeys, and API abuse controls.
- **Safe grounded facts:** RFC 9700 is a 2025 best-current-practice update for OAuth 2.0. OpenAPI describes an interface; it does not prove implementation behavior or security.
- **Limits:** Never publish secrets/private schemas or prescribe a flow without client/threat context. Apply GATE-03 and GATE-04.

### KR-07

- **Original sources:** [CISA SBOM resources](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom), [NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final), [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground dependency inventory, vendor evaluation, provenance, and integration failure planning.
- **Safe grounded facts:** An SBOM improves component transparency but does not establish safety. A repository score is a signal, not due diligence.
- **Limits:** Current vendor terms, APIs, quotas, subprocessors, and vulnerabilities require GATE-04 and GATE-09.

## Evidence gates

- **TOPIC-GATE:** GATE-04, GATE-09

If a gate affects the article's main conclusion, keep a visible `[NEEDS ...]` marker for coordinator review. Do not guess.

## Internal-link plan

### Existing local routes

- `/` — use only if it helps the reader's next step; verify the anchor describes the destination.

### Planned sibling articles

These are future routes. Do not link them as live until their HTML exists.

- [ ] Every H2 above has been replaced with finished, non-repetitive prose.
- [ ] Facts, project facts, inferences, assumptions, and judgments are not blurred together.
- [ ] Every consequential claim has an original source or `[NEEDS ...]` marker.
- [ ] No exact standard clause, number, price, test result, capacity, warranty, or personal experience was invented.
- [ ] Internal links use exact listed routes and helpful natural anchors.
- [ ] Future sibling routes are not presented as live.
- [ ] The public prose does not mention prompts, outlines, SEO, AI, or evidence gates.
- [ ] Front matter is preserved; `status` changed from `outline` to `draft` only after completion.
- [ ] Conclusion gives a concrete next action and an honest limit.
