# Responsive Web, PWA, atau Native App

## Assignment lock

- **Writer task:** Expand this file into one complete article answering: “Responsive Web, PWA, atau Native App”
- **Reader and situation:** Founder considering an app because users are mobile
- **Reader outcome:** Compare installability, discoverability, device APIs, offline use, performance, distribution, updates, cost, and user need
- **Primary intent:** Choose the appropriate mobile product surface
- **Reader community:** `Codev.id`
- **Primary friendly address:** `Sobat Codev.id`
- **Natural variants:** `Kawan Codev.id` and `Teman Codev.id`
- **Address cadence:** use a friendly project-community address three to five times in a typical long article, only at natural conversational pivots.
- **Scope boundary:** Does not claim Codev app-delivery experience; CDV-20-A01 owns capability proof and CDV-03-A03 owns stack choice
- **Final public route:** `/artikel/responsive-web-pwa-atau-native-app.html`
- **Appointed CMS date:** `2025-06-26` (`editorial_backfill`; preserve exactly)
- **Target length:** normally 1,400–2,200 useful words; stop earlier if the answer is complete.
- **Do not drift:** do not turn this page into a broad category page, sales landing page, or substitute for professional/project approval.

## Opening instructions

- Open with the exact short salutation: **“Halo, Sobat Codev.id!”**
- Start with the concrete decision, confusion, risk, or costly shortcut behind **Responsive Web, PWA, atau Native App**.
- Give the short answer within the first two or three paragraphs.
- State what evidence or condition can change that answer.
- Later, sprinkle `Sobat Codev.id`, `Kawan Codev.id`, or `Teman Codev.id` at useful warnings, decisions, examples, or the conclusion; do not force them into every section.
- Do not use a generic industry-history or “Di era digital” introduction.

## Evidence packet

Use the original source links below. Do not cite this outline or `GLOBAL_RESEARCH.md`.

### KR-03

- **Original sources:** [AWS Architecture Decision Records guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html), [WHATWG HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [HTTP Semantics RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110).
- **Purpose for this article:** Support explicit architecture trade-offs and standards-based web behavior.
- **Safe grounded facts:** Static, server-rendered, client-rendered, CMS, custom, monolithic, modular, and serverless are options—not maturity ranks.
- **Limits:** AWS examples are vendor guidance, not a required method. No stack recommendation without GATE-01 and GATE-02.

### KR-11

- **Original sources:** [WCAG 2.2 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), [WCAG-EM 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/), [WAI Easy Checks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground accessible design, implementation, evaluation, procurement, and maintenance.
- **Safe grounded facts:** Full-page and process scope matter. Keyboard/focus, semantics, forms/errors, reflow/zoom, authentication, media, and assistive-technology behavior cannot be certified by one scanner.
- **Limits:** WCAG conformance is not automatically Indonesian legal compliance. Apply GATE-05 and GATE-06.

## Evidence gates

- **TOPIC-GATE:** GATE-02, GATE-06

If a gate affects the article's main conclusion, keep a visible `[NEEDS ...]` marker for coordinator review. Do not guess.

## Internal-link plan
