# Monolith, Modular, Serverless, atau Layanan Terpisah

## Assignment lock

- **Writer task:** Expand this file into one complete article answering: “Monolith, Modular, Serverless, atau Layanan Terpisah”
- **Reader and situation:** Product team choosing an initial or target architecture
- **Reader outcome:** Compare coupling, deployment, data, failure, testing, team, latency, cost, and migration implications
- **Primary intent:** Compare software structural styles by real constraints
- **Reader community:** `Codev.id`
- **Primary friendly address:** `Sobat Codev.id`
- **Natural variants:** `Kawan Codev.id` and `Teman Codev.id`
- **Address cadence:** use a friendly project-community address three to five times in a typical long article, only at natural conversational pivots.
- **Scope boundary:** Does not declare microservices or serverless universally superior; CDV-11-A01 owns Cloudflare deployment choice
- **Final public route:** `/artikel/monolith-modular-serverless-atau-layanan-terpisah.html`
- **Appointed CMS date:** `2025-05-13` (`editorial_backfill`; preserve exactly)
- **Target length:** normally 1,400–2,200 useful words; stop earlier if the answer is complete.
- **Do not drift:** do not turn this page into a broad category page, sales landing page, or substitute for professional/project approval.

## Opening instructions

- Open with the exact short salutation: **“Halo, Sobat Codev.id!”**
- Start with the concrete decision, confusion, risk, or costly shortcut behind **Monolith, Modular, Serverless, atau Layanan Terpisah**.
- Give the short answer within the first two or three paragraphs.
- State what evidence or condition can change that answer.
- Later, sprinkle `Sobat Codev.id`, `Kawan Codev.id`, or `Teman Codev.id` at useful warnings, decisions, examples, or the conclusion; do not force them into every section.
- Do not use a generic industry-history or “Di era digital” introduction.

## Evidence packet

Use the original source links below. Do not cite this outline or `GLOBAL_RESEARCH.md`.

### KR-03

- **Original sources:** [AWS Architecture Decision Records guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html), [WHATWG HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [HTTP Semantics RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110).
- **Purpose for this article:** Support explicit architecture trade-offs and standards-based web behavior.
- **Safe grounded facts:** Static, server-rendered, client-rendered, CMS, custom, monolithic, modular, and serverless are options—not maturity ranks.
- **Limits:** AWS examples are vendor guidance, not a required method. No stack recommendation without GATE-01 and GATE-02.

### KR-07

- **Original sources:** [CISA SBOM resources](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom), [NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final), [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/).
- **Purpose for this article:** Ground dependency inventory, vendor evaluation, provenance, and integration failure planning.
- **Safe grounded facts:** An SBOM improves component transparency but does not establish safety. A repository score is a signal, not due diligence.
- **Limits:** Current vendor terms, APIs, quotas, subprocessors, and vulnerabilities require GATE-04 and GATE-09.

## Evidence gates

- **TOPIC-GATE:** GATE-02

If a gate affects the article's main conclusion, keep a visible `[NEEDS ...]` marker for coordinator review. Do not guess.

## Internal-link plan

### Existing local routes

- `/` — use only if it helps the reader's next step; verify the anchor describes the destination.

### Planned sibling articles

These are future routes. Do not link them as live until their HTML exists.

- End with an operating rule or honest boundary. Do not end with a generic summary.

## Draft completion checklist

- [ ] Opening answers the main question within two or three paragraphs.
- [ ] The article opens with `Halo, Sobat Codev.id!` and uses friendly `Codev.id` community address naturally three to five times total.
- [ ] Every H2 above has been replaced with finished, non-repetitive prose.
- [ ] Facts, project facts, inferences, assumptions, and judgments are not blurred together.
- [ ] Every consequential claim has an original source or `[NEEDS ...]` marker.
- [ ] No exact standard clause, number, price, test result, capacity, warranty, or personal experience was invented.
- [ ] Internal links use exact listed routes and helpful natural anchors.
- [ ] Future sibling routes are not presented as live.
- [ ] The public prose does not mention prompts, outlines, SEO, AI, or evidence gates.
- [ ] Front matter is preserved; `status` changed from `outline` to `draft` only after completion.
- [ ] Conclusion gives a concrete next action and an honest limit.
